# Black jack

The project is based one of my first react apps, developed during the coding bootcamp course.
I updated it to React 18, using functional components with hooks, also made some refactoring.

## Rules

- Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down)
- Blackjack card values: All cards count their face value in blackjack. 
Picture cards count as 10 and the ace can count as either 1 or 11. 
Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand
- Players must decide whether to stand or hit.
- The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21.
- Players win when their hand totals higher than the dealerâ€™s hand, or they have 21 or less when the dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21).
